    # The "app" cache stores to the filesystem by default.
    # The data in this cache should persist between deploys.
    # Other options include:

    # Redis
    app: cache.adapter.redis
    default_redis_provider: '%env(resolve:REDIS_DSN)%'

  # APCu (not recommended with heavy random-write workloads as memory fragmentation can cause perf issues)
  #app: cache.adapter.apcu

  # Namespaced pools use the above "app" backend by default
  #pools:
  #my.dedicated.cache: null
